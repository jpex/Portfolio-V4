   Forming a Design Critique Meeting
  </h1>
</div>

One of the most common issues with design work is collecting feedback on work from other designers. Candid, useful feedback is also essential to the design process. The following is a format for a design critique I created while at ATTN:.

A core group of designers meet every week, while related teams (development, product, animation, etc.) have a rotating schedule.

## Design Critique
Design critique is a formal process of gathering feedback across different teams. We meet <strong>once a week</strong> for **one hour**, in person and/or video calling. All designers can present. This **optional meeting** can include designers, developers, product managers, animation members, and stakeholders.

A core group of designers meet every week, while related teams have a rotating schedule.

### What design critiques are for
* Give suggested (not required) feedback to a designer.
* Giving designers a different perspective on their work from designers and non-designers.
* Giving designs better product direction, and a unified branding direction across these products.
* Making sure our branding guidelines are consistent across various products and teams.
* Looping in the technical perspective earlier into the product lifecycle.
* A supplement to existing feedback structures.
* Presenting practical work, while occasionally showcasing concept work.
* Improve candor between different teams.

### What design critiques are not
* A replacement for PMs, slack, hangouts, 1–1 design conversations.
* Prescriptive.
* A design by committee.
* Provider of new requirements for the presenter.

### Flow of the meeting
* Moderator mentions all of the presentations covered in the meeting.
* Presenter showcases their work.
* Moderator asks the audience if they understand the problem.
* Audience responds, asks its questions.
* Presenter goes over the audience questions.
* Moderator asks the presenter what the next steps are. The presenter responds.
* The presentation is complete. The cycle repeats until there are no more presentations.

### Roles

There are three roles involved in every critique. There is a **presenter**, a **moderator**, and an **audience**. The presenter(s) is showcasing their work. The moderator is the schedule creator, enforcer, and note taker. The audience understands the set problem and asks questions.

### Presenter(s)
<strong>Describe what problem they are trying to solve.</strong> This is important for all presentations. The audience should be able to understand what the problem is, and why it is worth working on.

Example:
*“I am working on X, dealing with the problem of Y, because Z.”*

*“I am working on layout ideas for our company's about page. The page is lacking information, and inconsistent with our branding.”*

*“Our current about page is outdated and reflects poorly on our branding. Improving this page will help sell our brand to prospective partners. User trust from our power users may also improve.”*

**Provide context to the work you are presenting.** Do you have older or alternative compositions to show? Were there general reasons why we are not going in a different direction?

Example:
*“My first iteration had a fixed footer at the bottom for a user to navigate. I scrapped it because there were too many navigable options, and they could not fit.”*

In this example, the audience gets a better picture on navigation. It also gives them an opportunity to frame a question that might make that iteration viable again. e.g. “What if we were able to reduce the navigation count from 7 to 4?”

**Describe what they are looking for in their presentation.** Work presented will vary in where it is. It could range from physical sketches to pixel perfect prototypes. The audience should have a general idea of where it is in the creative process.

*I am working on the information architecture of our header. I would like feedback on: What information has priority over others? What edge cases might exist for this? How much info should we show? Thoughts on a general design direction for this piece.*

**Describe what they are not looking for in their presentation.**

Example:

*“I am not looking for high fidelity aesthetics. I am more interested in the layout direction.”*

**What user personas are relevant to your work?** It is important that everyone knows who this work is for. There is a good chance both the presenter and the audience are not the end user. It should be clear to both parties what the user persona(s) look like.

**Is there any data you can provide to guide your design decisions?**

Example:
*“I went with blue here because we found in product testing that users clicked on this 50% more often.”*

*“Our clickthrough on this card is under 1%, and I believe this design direction will improve it to at least 2%.”*

**When presenting the visuals, go over the details you want to highlight.** It may be helpful to use a service such as Invision to comment out areas you want to talk about.

**Collaborate with the moderator before the meeting.** For scheduling purposes, and to make sure the presenter knows what to talk about.
* Do you need some special setup to present? What is the medium of presentation? Invision? Keynote? Sketch? Chrome? Sticky notes?
* How much time do you think it will take to go over everything before the audience has a chance to react? This can be tricky to figure out ahead of time. Going over the specifics with the moderator should give a sense of time for both sides.
* Do you have a problem identified, and an idea for why we should be tackling this problem?

### Moderator
The moderator's role is to make sure the meeting is as effective as possible. To keep the focus of these meetings on design, the moderator is in general a designer.

**Record the notes brought up in the meeting.**
* What questions did people ask?
* What was the response from others to that question?
* Were there any important takeaways from the presentation?

These notes will be available to every member of the meeting.</p>
**Can also be an audience member, but cannot be a presenter.**

**Makes sure the presenter has identified the problem.**

Asks **“Is the problem known to everyone, and is a problem worth solving?”** to the audience. This happens before the audience has started with their questions.

Asks **“What are the next steps for this project?”** to the presenter. This happens after the audience has finished with their questions.

### Audience
The audience is everyone who is not presenting. Their role is to understand the given problem, and ask questions. A good audience member asks questions related to many fields.

Areas of interest include:
* Product direction
* Technical constraints
* Branding considerations
* User needs
* Business needs.

**Questions an audience member can consider:**
Do you understand the problem? Could we reframe the problem? Is there a better problem we could be solving with this design? Is this problem even worth solving?

**Start with what you like about the design.**

*“After the designer has shown everyone what they did and why they did it, everyone starts with what they liked. After all, there’s something to like in any designer’s work. Pointing out the likes isn’t just an exercise to be nice and respectful. It helps everyone understand the qualities that are desirable. (This is one place where criticism-focused design reviews often fail miserably.)”

**Pose your thoughts as questions.**
Questions allow the presenter to consider new angles and elaborate on their own reasoning. These meetings make suggestions, not commands.

**Examples of feedback (with alternatives)**
*“I don’t like it.”*

This is vague and unhelpful. Why don't you like it? Where could improvements be? Can you frame the problem areas in the form of a question?

Alternatives:
*“Do you think the end user would engage with this social campaign? Our typical persona might, but I don't know about the one for this project.”*

*“Have you considered what the design would look like if these images took priority over these headlines?”*

*“How do you feel about the ratio of spacing between the filter options and the search bar?”*

*“Have you considered what this looks like to those with red/green color blindness?”*
