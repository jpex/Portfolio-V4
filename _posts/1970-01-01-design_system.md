### What is this?
The ATTN: Design System was a living document of UI standards for the website attn.com. Both design files and front-end artifacts, this system enabled us to quickly design and implement projects.

### What was my role?
As the main design contributor, I was responsible for defining the visual styling of common UI patterns, accessibility audits, creating and maintaining design files, enforcing project handoffs as compliant with our design system, reviewing developer implementations, and conducting A/B testing.


## UI Elements

### Media UIs
Being a media company, the design system needed UI pieces that were mobile, media, and end-user friendly for a variety of scenarios.

### Accessibility

Branding colors used in our video content did not always translate well for our site. One responsibility of mine was insuring that UI colors met [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) guidelines for contrast. This meant modifying color values to meet at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio (WCAG level AA)

### Handoffs

*Example of a handoff that used Invision + Craft + Sketch*

I was responsible the handoff process of design files. The design rules I enforced within the design workflow was also consistent with our front-end code. This made the implementation stage easier between both design and development — communication overhead was low, and implementation reviews were quick.

### Iterating the UI

There were frequent requests to test UI components on our site in relation to KPIs such as click-thru rate. I was also responsible for designing, coding, running, and evaluating many A/B tests. I ran over 50 A/B tests on UI elements during my time at ATTN:.

### Result
As someone who has worked in UX design and front-end development, I made sure this design system was consistent and worthwhile for both designers and developers.

The result was a consistent design language for future designers at ATTN: to adopt, and less obscurity in implementation requirements for developers.

Any new UX hires would be able to immediately use my UI solutions and rulesets. Front-end developers would be given assets with UI and branding consistency. Product Managers could utilize the Sketch tools for their own tasks.
