### What is this?
iFit, a fitness web application, offered a free and paid service that was bundled with treadmill product purchases from its parent company. Account registration was an essential step in connecting the service to the product.

### Why was this made?
The existing registration process had substantial usability issues, resulting in call center costs, reduced new subscriber rates from treadmill purchases, and lower goodwill from first timer users.

### What was my role?
Originally, I was the front-end developer in charge of implementing the initial registration process. Later on, I advocated for, and helped designed the second pass on registration. I was responsible for auditing the initial registration process, conducting usability tests, producing the new user flow, producing the low/mid-fidelity UI, and seeking stakeholder buy-in.


### Original User Flow
What It Took Before a User Could Use (or See) the Service
![](/images/ifit/user-flow.png)
Creating an account involved a labyrinth of different options, where arbitrary answers could trigger different account types. It was a byproduct of no underlying strategy — several stakeholders, spanning years, had needs that the registration process could ‘solve’ in the short run.

### Usability Testing
Up to this point, we never did usability testing. I wanted to demonstrate the issues of registration firsthand, so I ran a few in-house usability testing sessions. Our parent company, a manufacturer of fitness equipment, had a testing facility for its physical equipment. Without a budget, I had 6 different testers, and 3 non-product employees, attempt to create an account.

### Big Findings from Usability testing

#### Too Many Steps

26 user interactions is the minimum requirement to both register and pay for an account.

#### No Labels

What field means what? Label-less input fields, while having an aesthetic appeal, have significant accessibility issues. The W3C recommends against [placeholder text as a substitue for labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/common-input-element-attributes.html#the-placeholder-attribute).

#### How do I set up a free vs paid account?
Even the employees couldn't figure out how to. There was no direct way to choose, and no supporting pricing page.

#### Color Contrast Issues

#### Errors in the flow

### First Pass Proposal
![](/images/ifit/approach-1.png)
My first proposed registration process was intentionally radical. It was difficult to determine which stakeholders wanted what, and removing all non-vital steps encouraged them to make real tradeoffs.

The user test results and proposal brought out a lot of new context unknown to the team and myself. For example, fitness companies face some liability related to the age of users, and the birthday question serves as both a product feature and a legal question.</p>

### The New Registration Process
I designed a few iterations of the registration process that balanced the need to register for the service with marketing needs, technical limitations, and legal concerns.

As we came closer to a consensus, I also began testing proposed interfaces with users as well. In early iterations, it was just an InVision walkthrough. On later proposals, I coded out the basic front-end interactions of the new UI to get a real comparison of how users would fare.

#### Before and After: Page 1

The big changes: Proper labels, contrast meeting WCAG guidelines, password rules (multiple users in testing only saw the rule after they made an error), usernames were removed entirely (they served no user purpose).

#### Before and After: Page 2

The big changes: Fitness information needs are done after account creation. Activation codes were important because they were tied equipment purchases, and was what determined free vs. paid accounts.

## Results

#### Old Registration
Average time to completion: 3 minutes

#### New Registration
Average time to completion: 1 minute, 50 seconds

Reduction in errors (in testing): 2/3rd

### Implementation
Technical constraints were significant. Legacy equipment had unchangeable features that made some steps necessary. This meant implementation was gradually rolled out 

The biggest issues ended up being on the technical side. Legacy support of old fitness equipment (built-in tablets) caused this system to be gradually rolled out over a long period of time.

### Lessons
Invest in more detailed analytics. We didn’t have hard numbers on error triggers or drop rates on specific fields. This kind of quantitative information would have made consensus building easier, and more accurate diagnosis.

One-on-one interviews with stakeholders. I presented my work in groups, but a lot of the nuances of individual fields only came when stakeholders were separated.

From the business perspective, having a product management/owner layer. So much information and coordination was decentralized among different groups.

Be more cognizant of other touchpoints in the product. This flow was in many ways a crutch — there was no easy way for users to edit their fitness information at the start, and no real marketing pages for account types. A more cohesive plan of action would have benefited users more.
