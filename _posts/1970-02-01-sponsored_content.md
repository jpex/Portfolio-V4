### What is this?
ATTN:, a startup media company, needed a way to create and disclose posts from paid sponsors on our website. Before this project, there was no means of calling out such content.

### What was my role?
My role was to design sponsored content UIs that met the needs of our sales team, paid sponsors, the writing staff, end consumers, and legal entities. This includes how it would be displayed across the site, the CMS publishing flow, identifying needs for each type of user, competitive analysis from other media companies, designing different layouts for different sponsorship types, asset guidelines, and building Keynote assets for the sales team.

### Overview
The UX of ads involves a balance of meeting different types of user needs. In this scenario, the business goal and end user experience are in conflict. Following the business model of audience aggregation, UX can properly identify other users — the internal sales team, the prospect client/agent, and internal writing staff.

UX therefore has the goal of minimizing end user inconvenience, while maximizing the CTR of ads. From a KPI perspective, success can be measured by Bounce Rate, Pages/Session, and Ad CTR.

### Competitive analysis

![](/images/sc/ca.png)
*Collage of different media entities using sponsored content. Each company had their own angle to it, with a UI to reflect it.*

Media competitors had already tackled sponsored content in the past. As part of the exploration with stakeholders, I gathered together competitive analysis to identify what both they and potential clients wanted in the presentation. This help solidify the different types of sponsored content that would exist.

## Deliverables

The UI presented to a user is dependent on the type of sponsorship provided. There were three categories of sponsorship: sponsoring an entire vertical/section of the site, sponsoring individual articles, and video sponsors.

### Story Ads

![](/images/sc/ad.png)
*UI when a company has sponsored a story.*

![](/images/sc/author.png)
*A sponsored author, when they are responsible for the publishing of a story. These kind of low traffic pages would not need to be optimized.*

### Vertical/Section Ads

![](/images/sc/vertical.png)
*UI when a company has sponsored a complete category of stories.*

### Header

![](/images/sc/header.png)
*UI for category callout at the header level.*

### Selected Handoffs

![](/images/sc/stage.png)
*Front-end supplementary info — dealing with different sponsor scenarios, and a logic to logo sizing.*

![](/images/sc/kn.png)
*Keynote assets for our sales team. This allowed the sales team to easily simulate accurate scenarios for prospective clients.*

## Results

**Bounce Rate/Pages Per Sesson**: No significant difference between sponsored and non-sponsored pages.

The **CTR** metric is proprietary.

Some viral successful sponsored posts [archived blog mention](https://www.attn.com/blog/15605/attn-video-matchcom-number-one-brandtale/).
