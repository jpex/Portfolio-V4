## Introduction
Designers are employed to add value to a product or service. We take the end user and the business’ need to create something usable and desirable. It’s not just about making a site/app look pretty — many different design subfields are used to create this experience.

The specific means of doing this varies from project to project. The general process of achieving this looks like:

#### Figuring out what we need to design / solve for
* Researching the problem
* Defining the problem

#### Designing a solution to that problem
* Ideate many potential answers
* Iterate the answers to a polished deliverable

This UX design process should empower the entire product development team to understand, and advocate for, the user.

### Figuring out what we need to design/solve for
Design can only be useful when it understands the problem it’s trying to solve. There are many practical questions you could ask at the start. Here are some of them:

Is this a new product/service? Established? How mature is the design team? The company? What sort of product development methodology is used? Is there a product/project manager/owner layer? Is this is a consumer product? Business-to-business? What are the technical goals and capabilities? What usage metrics might exist? Is there an established product or brand strategy? What budget exists for research? What ‘economic value’ does the business offer in this context (e.g. a ‘product’, ‘service’, ‘audience aggregator’)?

Some methods I have used in this discovery phase:

**Usability testing**. At iFit ([case study](/ifit)), I used usability testing to identify and validate a problem users had with account creation. The usability test showed users frustrated spending several minutes filling in forms, while showing the business causes for failed conversions (lost revenue) and complaints to their call center (increased costs).

**A/B testing** can help build cases for design and marketing directions. At ATTN: for example, I designed, built, and analyzed over 40 individual A/B tests. These tests can validate a post-launch design [such as sponsored content on a media site](/sponsored_content), improve conversion on social CTAs, or improve bounce rate KPIs. I might use a tool like Optimizely for the task, and write short debriefs accessible to anyone interested.

**Analytic tools** such as Google Analytics and Heap give designers a quantitative front for identifying user problems. I regularly use these services to extract data, set up events, and explore user funnels.

This data also helps avoid designing or prioritizing for the wrong thing. For example, in one project I had to design a landing and child pages for original content, with an ambiguous scope. I used our analytics to show that our user’s current journey through the site would produce little traffic. I was able to keep design scope on the project limited to an MVP.

I also use **competitive analysis** regularly. This gives the design team and myself a better sense of the domain, and what user flows are currently like elsewhere.

**User interviews** are also an established part of the design process. Contextual inquiry is a useful methodology here — focusing on context of use is important. I have found user interviews based around marketing goals (branding, market segmentations, focus groups, surveys) are not as useful.

If we’re working with a new product and/or lack direct access to users, a [provisional persona](http://eleganthack.com/tweaking-the-persona) can also get things moving.

### Designing a solution to that problem

*User polls — an example of an iterative approach of designing polls.*


Once we as a design team have converged on the problem we want to solve, we diverge out many possible design solutions.

User journeys are commonplace here. Existing products might also pair analytics with this to quantify aspects of it.

Prototyping out a concept by code is also viable — my [CodePen account](https://codepen.io/jpex/) contains many design concepts. This doesn’t mean producing production-ready code, more as a tool for prototyping and a potential guide for developers.

I might also run/support a meeting like a [design critique](/design_critique) to support candid feedback among the design team.

For graphics programs, Sketch or Photoshop get the job done as a primary tool. Secondary options might include in browser, Figma or Keynote.

### Design Support

Design is not over when sketch files are all polished up. Project specs are created as necessary for developers. Spec depth will vary due to factors such as project complexity, the role of product managers and developer methodology. For most projects that come out of an agile environment, these specs are usually an interactive Invision prototype that produces accurate UI rules using Craft, along with a simple document coauthored between myself and a product manager.

<p>Part of the larger, long-term relationship with development can include a unified design language between the two teams. At ATTN: for example, I maintained a living <a href="design_system">design system</a> that was enforced between both teams. Visual details like font/space scales, colors, common UI patterns were used consistently across design projects. </p>

Implementation reviews are also standard for projects. Much like developers undergo code reviews, design reviews are also important.

### Retrospectives

<p>No project runs perfectly. <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/norman-s-three-levels-of-design">Reflective thinking</a> is a useful way to approach projects after the fact. I try to apply lessons in each case study. I also advocate for sprint retrospectives with the product development team as a whole. </p>
